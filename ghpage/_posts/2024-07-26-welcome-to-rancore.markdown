This is my first blog post for this project.<br>

RanCore is my very own Java library for educational purposes. Since I'm currently studying Applied Computer Science, 
I figured I could use this project to collect any useful stuff, create templates of all kind etc. and just have a repository for my ideas.
I'm really excited to see where this is going, since I'm learning new things everyday!
